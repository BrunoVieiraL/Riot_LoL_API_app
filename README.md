# Riot League of Legends App<p>

This project was made using some APIs to get the information about the champions of the game.<p>
The objective of doing this was to pratice API consume and turn out was kinda challenging because of the complexity of the JSON data but at the end i learned a lot and prove to myself that i can handle a API call even a more complex one, comparing with JsonPlaceholderAPI.<p>
The first image is the home page, that show a grid list of all the champions.<p>
The second image is the details page, when you click on a champion in the grid go to this page, here you have the champion selected spells and a list of skins.<p>
The third one shows all the skins that champion have and the spells show the descrpition when you tap on the image of that spell.<p>
