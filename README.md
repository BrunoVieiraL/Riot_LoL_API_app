# Riot League of Legends App<p>

This project was made using some APIs to get the information about the champions of the game.<p>
The objective of doing this was to pratice API consume and turn out was kinda challenging because of the complexity of the JSON data but at the end i learned a lot and prove to myself that i can handle a API call even a more complex one, comparing with JsonPlaceholderAPI.
